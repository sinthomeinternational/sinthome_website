Theory always seems to concern what is already present, while the revolutionary points toward the future. How, then, can there be a revolutionary theory? The lecture answers: if there is one, it is dialectical materialism.

Although Marx himself never used this term, in Capital he explicitly declared the need to "invert" Hegel's dialectic and strip away its mystical shell. The lecture therefore begins with Hegel: his dialectic sought to bridge the gap between necessity and certainty, to reveal the mutual determination of form and content, thought and sensory experience, and through negation to arrive at new knowledge, ultimately culminating in "absolute knowledge." The distinctive feature of Hegel's dialectic is that it treats the production of knowledge as the unfolding of the Idea itself, imbued with theological and metaphysical presuppositions.

The lecturer pointed out that Marx's decisive turn lay in discarding Hegel's metaphysical presuppositions and examining every given phenomenon from the perspective of production and reproduction, thereby laying the foundation for dialectical materialism.

Unlike Hegel, dialectical materialism does not search for an absolute starting point but begins from concrete phenomena and practices. No phenomenon is isolated; each is the result of multiple interacting processes, i.e. "overdetermined." Hence, what is given is not a static object but a relational whole, produced and reproduced in practice. In this view, thought itself is part of reality, operating within ideology and social relations. Crucially, dialectical materialism is not merely an epistemology or explanatory method, but a practice-oriented theory. In this sense, it constitutes the revolutionary methodology and intellectual weapon upon which Marxism rests.
