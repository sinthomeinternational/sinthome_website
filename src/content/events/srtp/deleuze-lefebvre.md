Imagine yourself on a speeding train. Outside the window, rows of factories, schools, and prisons stretch endlessly along the tracks. Within these institutions, people live atomized, homogenized lives. Just as you begin to question how this system operates, a voice over the intercom announces:

*"Dear passengers, we have arrived at our current stop: the Disciplinary Society. The next and final destination of this train: Cybernetic Governance! Please prepare to disembark."*

You wonder—why is this the final stop? Stepping off the train and looking back, you suddenly understand. Stamped boldly across the side of the train are five unmistakable characters: Late Capitalism.

This seminar invites you to join us in deconstructing late capitalism and its apparatuses of control. Together, we will examine how the spaces of our daily lives—and even our very bodies—are managed, governed, and shaped by the logic of late capitalist society.
