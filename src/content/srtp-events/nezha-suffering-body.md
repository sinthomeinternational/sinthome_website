description: "## Overview

When we talk about ethics, we often begin from the outside: duty, command, the face of the other. But this lecture begins elsewhere—with the suffering body.

In Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology, the body is the stylist of our access to the world, the site where meaning sediments and the self comes into being. Yet when suffering arrives, all of this is shattered: the body no longer organizes perception but becomes the fissure where perception collapses; the world is no longer inhabitable, and the body is no longer 'me.'

## The Revolutionary Body

In this rupture, ethics first appears—not as norm, duty, or response, but as the most urgent practical question: how can I, in the place of the unbearable, construct for myself a 'body that can exist'?

Here we turn to the story of Nezha: he does not sacrifice himself, but denies the body shaped by fate and bloodline, and in the fissure remakes a new body out of lotus flowers. He responds to 'that which cannot be responded to' not with obedience, but with action—opening up a 'revolutionary bodily ethics.' Not repair, not compassion, but practice, creation, the reconstruction of form.

## Contemporary Relevance

This is precisely the problem faced by communities today: we each carry pain, anxiety, the weight of identity and history. But can we, like Nezha, do more than endure these ruptures? Can we, in the fissures of body and life, use action to remake a new shared form?

The lecture unfolds around the triadic structure of suffering—body—form, and invites us to reflect together: ethics is not just an idea; it may be the most urgent way of living for us today."
