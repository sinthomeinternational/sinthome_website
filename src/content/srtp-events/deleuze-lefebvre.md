## The Production of Space

Space is not merely a container for social relations but is actively produced through social practices. This lecture examines Henri Lefebvre's triadic conception of space—perceived, conceived, and lived—and how Gilles Deleuze's philosophy of difference and multiplicity offers new ways to understand spatial production.

## Spatial Practice and Everyday Life

Lefebvre argued that space is produced through a dialectical relationship between:
- **Spatial practice**: How space is perceived and used in daily routines
- **Representations of space**: How planners, architects, and technocrats conceive space
- **Representational spaces**: The lived, symbolic dimensions of space

## Deleuze's Contribution

Deleuze and Guattari's concept of "smooth and striated space" provides a complementary framework for understanding how power operates through spatial organization. Their notion of assemblages helps us understand cities not as static forms but as dynamic multiplicities constantly being deterritorialized and reterritorialized.

## Contemporary Applications

The lecture connected these theories to contemporary urban struggles:
- Gentrification as spatial violence
- The right to the city movement
- Digital spaces and virtual territories
- Climate change and spatial justice

## Revolutionary Potential

Both thinkers saw space as a site of political struggle. For Lefebvre, the "right to the city" meant not just access to urban resources but the right to transform urban life. For Deleuze, revolutionary potential lies in creating new spatial assemblages that escape capture by dominant powers.

The discussion emphasized that understanding space as produced rather than given is essential for any emancipatory politics.
