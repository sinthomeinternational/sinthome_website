      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Sinthome Hackathon starts with a simple question: how can current AI tools be tailored to address real-world challenges in the practice of social good? We believe the answer does not lie in lofty ideals, but in grounding our work in the lived experiences of Boston's NGOs and local communities. By bringing together students, young professionals, and nonprofit workers, the hackathon fosters mutual learning across diverse perspectives and creates a shared space to reimagine how technology can be practiced in the service of public good. This year's subthemes highlight diverse challenges, from supporting Asian workers in Boston with language access, to providing peer counseling for youth mental health, to empowering small and medium-sized manufacturers through industry-specific AI agents.
