        <p class="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Plantcore.AI is committed to building the world's first Industrial Vertical Large Language Model (LLM) to drive a fundamental transformation in manufacturing. We believe the future of industry is not limited to automated execution but lies in the intelligent and collective structuring of decision-making. Every act of production is shaped by countless judgments and choices—decisions that are the true drivers of industry. Plantcore.AI begins from this reality, aiming to construct a new industrial intelligence system grounded in real-world decision data.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Method — Starting from Decisions</h2>
        <p class="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Current ERP systems record transactions and processes but fail to capture the on-the-ground choices made by workers and managers in real time. This blind spot prevents the accumulation of experiential data and blocks the path toward genuine intelligent decision-making. Plantcore.AI addresses this gap by deploying AI Agents directly on the factory floor to capture Context–Decision–Outcome (CDO) data. These agents deliver immediate ROI (≥10% procurement savings, ~7% inventory shrinkage reduction) while simultaneously creating a sustainable stream of decision assets.
        </p>
        <p class="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          On this basis, Plantcore.AI builds a three-layer architecture:

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Our Vision</h2>
        <p class="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Our vision is to build, within the next five years, a decision-data-driven industrial intelligence network through continuous agent deployment and CDO data collection. By 2030, Plantcore.AI will reach 10,000 factories and 150,000 AI Agents, generating hundreds of millions of validated decision samples.
        </p>
        <p class="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          On this foundation, we will train and deploy the world's first Industrial Vertical LLM—an engine of decision-making grounded in authentic factory data. This LLM will serve as the operating system of Industry 4.0, guiding real-time production choices, amplifying collective industrial knowledge, and reshaping how humans and machines collaborate in production.

        <p class="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed text-center">
          At Plantcore.AI, we believe the true industrial revolution is not the replacement of workers by machines, but the creation of an intelligent decision network—powered by an Industrial LLM—that redefines the relationship between humans and production, opening new possibilities for the industries and societies of the future.
