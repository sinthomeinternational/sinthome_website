   ↓
2. Sequence Number (48px, bold, zinc-800/40 - background element)
   ↓
3. Title (20px, semi-bold, white)
   ↓
4. Description (14px, regular, zinc-400)
```

**Why This Works:**
- Clear visual hierarchy (F-pattern reading)
- Each element has distinct purpose
- Spacing creates breathing room
- Professional typographic scale

#### Color Strategy

**Primary Brand Color (Red):**
- Accent bar: `from-red-600 to-red-700`
- Hover states: Increased opacity/saturation
- Strategic use: Not overwhelming, just highlighting

**Neutral Palette:**
- Backgrounds: `zinc-900/80` (semi-transparent)
- Borders: `zinc-800/80` (subtle separation)
- Text: `white` (titles), `zinc-400` (descriptions)

**Hover Enhancements:**
- Background: `zinc-900/80` → `zinc-900` (more solid)
- Border: `zinc-800/80` → `red-600/30` (brand color)
- Text: `zinc-400` → `zinc-300` (increased contrast)

- Similar to Palantir's dark-mode interfaces
- Follows 2025 trend of "dark mode with high-contrast accents"

#### Spacing & Layout

**Grid System:**
- 2-column grid on desktop (md:grid-cols-2)
- 1-column on mobile (grid-cols-1)
- 6-unit gap between cards (gap-6)

**Card Internal Spacing:**
- Padding: `p-8 pl-10` (extra left padding for accent bar)
- Margin bottom between sections: `mb-5`, `mb-4`, `mb-5`
- Consistent rhythm throughout

**Whitespace Philosophy:**
- Generous padding creates premium feel
- Breathing room around text improves readability
- Aligns with minimalist aesthetic

- Science beaker (original #3): Childish, not industrial
- CPU/chip icon (original #4): Overused in tech industry

**Label Advantages:**
- "Intelligence" → Directly states the category
- "Impact" → Clear business value proposition
- "Scale" → Immediately communicates growth/network effects
- "Synergy" → Sophisticated term for collaboration

**Professional Vocabulary:**
- Aligns with enterprise B2B communication style
- No ambiguity or cultural interpretation issues
- Easy for sales/marketing teams to reference
- Memorable and distinctive

- Respects prefers-reduced-motion (if implemented in global CSS)

#### Recommendations for Enhancement:

```tsx
// Add ARIA labels for enhanced accessibility
<div
  role="article"
  aria-labelledby={`benefit-title-${index}`}
  className="relative bg-zinc-900/80..."
>
  <h4 id={`benefit-title-${index}`} className="text-xl font-semibold...">
    {benefit.title}
  </h4>
</div>
```

- **Control:** Left-aligned red bar (current)
- **Variant A:** Top-aligned red bar (horizontal)
- **Variant B:** No accent bar, border-only
- **Metric:** Click-through rate to "Request Demo"

#### Test 2: Typography Hierarchy
- **Control:** Label + Number + Title (current)
- **Variant A:** Number only (remove label)
- **Variant B:** Icon + Label + Title
- **Metric:** Time on page, scroll depth

#### Test 3: Color Intensity
- **Control:** Current opacity levels
- **Variant A:** More saturated red (opacity 100%)
- **Variant B:** Monochromatic (no red accents)
- **Metric:** User perception survey (professional vs. engaging)

**Expected Outcome:**
Based on research, current design should outperform icon-based variants for enterprise audience.

- Add loading skeleton states for perceived performance

**Example:**
```tsx
import { animate, useMotionValue, useTransform } from 'motion/react';

// Animated number counter
const count = useMotionValue(0);
const rounded = useTransform(count, (latest) => Math.round(latest));

useEffect(() => {
  if (isInView) {
    const animation = animate(count, parseInt(benefit.number), {
      duration: 2,
      ease: 'easeOut'
    });
    return animation.stop;
  }
}, [isInView]);
```

#### Phase 2: Data Visualization (1 month)
